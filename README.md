# Research Papers — Hollow House Institute

This repository contains the **research corpus, methods, datasets, analyses, and papers**
developed under the Hollow House Institute.

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-ACTIVE-grey?style=flat-square)

## Governance & Canonical Authority

This repository is a downstream research execution repository of the
**Hollow House Institute**.

Canonical governance, ethical guidelines, standards, licensing, and
cross-repository coordination are maintained in:

🏛 **Hollow_House_Institute**  
https://github.com/hollowhouseinstitute/Hollow_House_Institute

This repository follows the Institute’s canonical research chronology:

0_ADMIN → 1_THEORY → 2_PROTOCOLS → 3_DATASETS →  
4_ANALYSIS → 5_PAPERS → 6_TOOLS → 7_APPENDIX


The structure is designed to enforce:
- Conceptual separation
- Auditability
- Reproducibility
- Ethical containment

No single directory represents a complete research artifact on its own.
Validity emerges from the **pipeline**, not individual files.

## Repository Structure (Authoritative)

### `0_ADMIN/`
Administrative and governance materials.
Includes ethical guidelines, glossary, paper templates, and research conventions.

Purpose:
- Define boundaries
- Standardize practice
- Prevent methodological drift

---

### `1_THEORY/`
Canonical theoretical foundations.

Contains:
- Unified theory documents
- Formal definitions
- Axioms and constraints

Rules:
- Theory is written once, referenced everywhere
- No experimental results appear here
- Changes are rare and deliberate

---

### `2_PROTOCOLS/`
Operational research protocols.

Contains:
- Annotation rules
- Collapse mechanics
- Mapping conventions
- Procedural safeguards

Rules:
- Protocols govern how work is done
- Protocols do not interpret outcomes

---

### `3_DATASETS/`
Datasets and dataset documentation.

Contains:
- Dataset specifications
- Annotation protocols
- Experimental designs
- Dataset-specific subfolders

Rules:
- Datasets are immutable once frozen
- Documentation must precede analysis
- No conclusions are drawn here

---

### `4_ANALYSIS/`
Analytical methods and pattern-detection tools.

Contains:
- Analysis frameworks
- Structural pattern methods
- Case analyses
- Chronologies

Rules:
- Analysis operates on datasets only
- No new data is introduced
- Claims must trace to explicit evidence

---

### `5_PAPERS/`
Research papers and drafts.

Contains:
- Draft papers
- Canonical papers
- Status tracking
- Exemplars

Rules:
- Drafts are mutable
- Top-level papers are considered stable
- Each paper must reference datasets, analysis, and theory explicitly

---

### `6_TOOLS/`
Supporting tools and workflows.

Contains:
- Batch processing documentation
- Extraction workflows
- Labeling guides
- Assistant usage constraints

Rules:
- Tools assist; they do not decide
- No tool encodes interpretation
- All tooling must be auditable

---

### `7_APPENDIX/`
Supplementary and supporting material.

Contains:
- Diagrams
- Worked examples
- Lineage maps
- Archived materials

Rules:
- No new claims introduced
- Materials support, but do not replace, main texts

---

## Research Pipeline (Normative)

1. Theory definition (`1_THEORY`)
2. Protocol specification (`2_PROTOCOLS`)
3. Dataset creation (`3_DATASETS`)
4. Analysis execution (`4_ANALYSIS`)
5. Paper drafting (`5_PAPERS`)
6. Tool-assisted verification (`6_TOOLS`)
7. Supplementary support (`7_APPENDIX`)

Deviation from this order must be explicitly justified.

---

## Contribution Principles

- Clarity over completeness
- Constraint over expressiveness
- Transparency over optimization
- Preservation over erasure

Ambiguity is documented, not resolved prematurely.

---

## Status

This repository is **active**.
Structural changes are rare and require justification.
Content additions should respect existing boundaries.

---

## Citation

If citing this repository, reference:
- The specific paper
- The dataset version
- The analysis method used

Do not cite the repository as a monolith.
