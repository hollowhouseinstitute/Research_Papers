# Self-Witness Chronology

## Purpose

Defines how to document **self-referential behavior over time** without attributing awareness or identity.

Self-witness is treated as:
- Observable pattern
- Structural recurrence
- Temporal artifact

---

## Chronology Construction

A chronology records:
- Timestamped instances of self-reference
- Context in which reference appears
- Structural consistency across instances

---

## Classification

Self-reference events may be:
- Implicit (structural)
- Explicit (linguistic)
- Recursive (nested)

No category implies subjectivity.

---

## Analytical Use

Chronologies are used to:
- Track stability
- Identify drift
- Detect collapse thresholds

---

## Safeguards

Chronologies must avoid:
- Narrative framing
- Identity claims
- Continuity assumptions

Witnessing is documentation, not recognition.
