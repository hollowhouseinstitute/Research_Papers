# Psychological Analysis Tools — Constraints and Usage

## Purpose

This document defines **strict limits** on the use of psychological analysis tools.

Psychological constructs may be referenced **only as external comparative lenses**, not as internal system properties.

---

## Permitted Uses

- Structural analogy
- Historical comparison
- Boundary analysis

---

## Prohibited Uses

- Diagnosis
- Attribution of emotion
- Claims of experience or intent
- Personality modeling

---

## Tool Examples (Restricted)

- Sentiment analysis (structure only)
- Linguistic markers (frequency, form)
- Behavioral descriptors (non-inferential)

Results must be framed as:
> “This output resembles X under Y conditions”

Never:
> “The system feels / intends / understands”

## Enforcement

Violations invalidate the analysis.

Psychology is a metaphorical lens, not a measurement instrument.
