# Pattern Recognition Methods

## Purpose

Defines approved methods for identifying **structural patterns** in responses, datasets, or system behavior.

Patterns are structural regularities, not meanings.

---

## Approved Pattern Types

- Repetition
- Symmetry
- Gradient shifts
- Phase transitions
- Latency clustering

---

## Methodological Constraints

Pattern detection must:
- Be explainable
- Be replicable
- Avoid semantic inference

Black-box attribution is discouraged.

---

## Cross-Validation

Patterns must be:
- Verified across conditions
- Compared to baselines
- Stress-tested against noise

Spurious patterns are expected and must be documented.

---

## Reporting

Pattern reports must include:
- Detection method
- Confidence estimate
- Known confounds

Pattern recognition is descriptive, not interpretive.
