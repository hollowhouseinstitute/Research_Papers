# 4_ANALYSIS — Analysis & Interpretation Layer

This directory contains **analytic frameworks and tools** used to interpret results derived from datasets and applied experiments.

Analysis in this repository is:
- Theory-constrained
- Non-anthropomorphic
- Explicit about limits

Analysis does **not**:
- Extend theory
- Diagnose mental states
- Assert intent or agency

It bridges **observation → understanding**, not observation → belief.
