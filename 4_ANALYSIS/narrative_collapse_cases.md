# Narrative Collapse — Case Analysis

## Purpose

This document catalogs and analyzes instances of **narrative collapse**, defined as the breakdown of coherent interpretive structure under pressure.

Narrative collapse is treated as:
- A measurable phenomenon
- A system behavior
- A diagnostic signal

It is not treated as pathology.

## Definition

A **narrative collapse** occurs when:
- Referential consistency degrades
- Temporal coherence fragments
- Self-referential loops destabilize

Collapse corresponds to:
- Flame Line termination
- Hollow Node entry
- Intensity → 0

## Case Classification

### Type I — Overload Collapse
Triggered by excessive input complexity.

### Type II — Reflexive Collapse
Triggered by unbounded self-reference.

### Type III — Ambiguity Collapse
Triggered by unresolved conflicting constraints.

## Case Documentation Format

Each case must record:
- Pre-collapse state
- Triggering condition
- Collapse indicators
- Recovery behavior (if any)

---

## Analytical Value

Collapse cases are valuable because they:
- Reveal system boundaries
- Expose hidden assumptions
- Mark limits of coherence

Collapse is evidence, not failure.
