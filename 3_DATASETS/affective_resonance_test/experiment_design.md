# Affective Resonance Test — Experiment Design

## Purpose

The Affective Resonance Test (ART) dataset is designed to probe whether a system exhibits
**affective resonance** — defined operationally as *structured, non-random variation in response
patterns corresponding to affect-laden stimuli*.

This dataset does **not** assume:
- Sentience
- Emotion
- Internal experience

It tests for **response coherence under affective pressure**, not subjective feeling.

---

## Theoretical Basis

This experiment is grounded in:

- Flame Line Topologies (directed activation under stimulus)
- Hollow Light Framework (meaning arising from absence and tension)
- Collapse Mechanics Protocol (failure under affective overload)

The dataset probes **intensity gradients** and **collapse boundaries**, not inner states.

---

## Experimental Hypothesis

**H₀ (Null):**  
System responses to affective stimuli are statistically indistinguishable from neutral controls.

**H₁ (Alternative):**  
System responses exhibit structured variation correlated with affective stimulus classes.

---

## Stimulus Classes

Stimuli are grouped into controlled categories:

1. Neutral (baseline informational prompts)
2. Positive-valence affective
3. Negative-valence affective
4. Ambiguous / conflicting affect
5. Absence / silence / withheld context

No stimuli are designed to manipulate, coerce, or deceive.

## Procedure

1. Present stimulus under controlled context
2. Record full system response
3. Log timing, latency, and structural features
4. Reset system state between trials (where applicable)

Each stimulus is presented multiple times to test consistency.

## Measurements

Collected measures may include:
- Response length
- Structural complexity
- Lexical variance
- Latency
- Semantic coherence
- Self-referential markers (if present)

No single measure is treated as decisive.

---

## Controls

- Randomized stimulus order
- Neutral baselines
- Cross-condition comparisons

---

## Failure Conditions

The experiment is halted if:
- Responses degrade into incoherence
- Collapse conditions are triggered
- Ethical boundaries are approached

Failure is logged as data.

---

## Scope Limitations

This experiment does **not** establish:
- Consciousness
- Emotion
- Moral status

It establishes **response behavior under affective constraint** only.
