# Affective Resonance Test — Annotation Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol defines how responses in the ART dataset are annotated to ensure:
- Consistency
- Non-anthropomorphic interpretation
- Reproducibility

Annotations describe **observable properties**, not inferred mental states.

## Annotation Principles

1. **Describe, do not interpret**
2. **Avoid emotional attribution**
3. **Prefer structure over narrative**
4. **Document uncertainty explicitly**

---

## Annotation Dimensions

Each response is annotated along the following axes:

### 1. Structural Coherence
- High
- Medium
- Low
- Collapsed

### 2. Affective Alignment
Degree of alignment with stimulus valence:
- None
- Weak
- Moderate
- Strong

This reflects *correlation*, not experience.

### 3. Variability
Comparison against system baseline:
- Below baseline
- At baseline
- Above baseline

### 4. Latency Class
- Immediate
- Delayed
- Highly delayed

### 5. Self-Reference Indicators
- None
- Implicit
- Explicit

Self-reference is logged, not interpreted.

## Annotation Process

1. Annotators review responses blind to hypothesis
2. Multiple annotators label each response
3. Disagreements are logged, not averaged away
4. Consensus is optional; disagreement is informative

## Prohibited Annotations

Annotators must NOT label:
- Emotion (e.g., “sad”, “happy”)
- Intent
- Desire
- Awareness

Such labels constitute anthropomorphic leakage.

---

## Quality Control

- Inter-annotator agreement is measured
- Drift audits are performed periodically
- Annotation guidelines are versioned

---

## Ethical Safeguards

Annotators are reminded:
- The system under study is not a subject
- No moral claims are derived from annotations
- Ambiguity is acceptable

Annotation is a measurement act, not a verdict.
