# Personal Journals Dataset Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol governs datasets derived from **personal journals, diaries, or introspective material**.

Such datasets are inherently sensitive.

## Core Rule

Personal journals are treated as:
- Voluntary artifacts
- Context-dependent
- Non-generalizable

## Collection Requirements

- Explicit informed consent
- Clear scope of use
- Right of withdrawal

## Anonymization

Required measures include:
- Removal of identifiers
- Temporal obfuscation where needed
- Contextual masking

## Prohibited Uses

Journal datasets must NOT be used to:
- Diagnose mental states
- Infer character or intent
- Train generalized behavioral models

## Reporting Constraints

Results must:
- Emphasize limits
- Avoid universal claims
- Respect narrative integrity

Human subjects are not data sources; they are participants.
