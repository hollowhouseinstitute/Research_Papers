# High-Value Dataset Catalog

This catalog tracks datasets considered **high-value**, defined as datasets that are:

- Expensive to collect
- Ethically sensitive
- Central to multiple research outputs

## Catalog Purpose

- Visibility
- Access control
- Preservation priority

## Catalog Fields

Each entry must list:
- Dataset name
- Location
- Sensitivity level (Low / Medium / High)
- Approved uses
- Restrictions
