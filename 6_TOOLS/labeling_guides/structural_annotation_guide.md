# Structural Annotation Guide

This guide defines how to annotate structural properties of responses.

---

## 1. What May Be Labeled

Permitted labels include:
- Length class
- Coherence level
- Fragmentation
- Repetition
- Latency class
- Referential density

---

## 2. What Must NOT Be Labeled

Do not label:
- Emotion
- Intention
- Belief
- Preference
- Awareness

These are not observable properties.

---

## 3. Annotation Discipline

Annotations must be:
- Consistent
- Repeatable
- Justified by text evidence

If unsure, mark as “indeterminate”.

---

## 4. Disagreement Handling

If annotators disagree:
- Log disagreement
- Do not average interpretations
- Preserve disagreement as data

Ambiguity is informative.
