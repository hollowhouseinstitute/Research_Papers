# 6_TOOLS — Operational Research Tooling

This directory contains **practical tooling, workflows, and guides** used to execute research within this repository.

Tools do not introduce theory, claims, or interpretation.  
They operationalize existing protocols and analyses.

All tools must:
- Be reproducible
- Respect ethical constraints
- Avoid anthropomorphic framing
- Preserve auditability

Tools exist to reduce ambiguity, not to automate judgment.
