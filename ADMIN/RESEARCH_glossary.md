# Glossary — Hollow House Institute

Short, working definitions. These are **operational**, not academic.

---

### House of Mirrors

The internal cognitive architecture where the self **reflects itself through layered stories**.  
Used as a **debugging theater** for identity, contracts, and narratives.

---

### Witness

The part of consciousness that **reports what’s happening without editing**.  
In protocols, “Witness” refers both to the *act* and the *record* (raw text, audio, etc).

---

### Scan Spine

A deliberate walkthrough of the **body + nervous system + field**, tracking:

- sensations  
- micro-movements  
- image flashes  
- internal dialogue  
- emotional spikes

It’s the “full system scan” that underpins most HHI protocols.

---

### Codex Mapping

The process of taking raw material (texts, conversations, sensations) and mapping them into:

- archetypes  
- patterns  
- relational configurations  
- temporal markers  
- contract structures  

This becomes a **codex** that can be queried like a database.

---

### Contract

Any **binding pattern** that shapes behavior, perception, or loyalty:

- explicit (e.g., “I will always sacrifice myself for X”)
- implicit (e.g., body tenses around certain people)
- inherited (ancestral, familial)

Contracts are named, mapped, and then either reinforced or collapsed.

---

### Collapse

The event where a **contract or identity structure fails, dissolves, or is revoked**.  
Not just a breakdown; it’s a chance to **rewrite internal law**.

---

### Architect Law

The layer of self that writes **new internal laws** after a collapse.  
These laws govern:

- how you interpret events  
- what you allow into your field  
- what you will or won’t do for others

---

### Mantra

A **compressed code phrase** carrying new law.  
Not about aesthetics; about **anchoring the new pattern** into the nervous system.

---

### Ledger

The running record of:

- witnesses  
- collapses  
- laws  
- mantras  
- experiments and results

Think: **version control for the soul’s operating system**.

---

### Affective Resonance

How strongly a given phrase, image, or interaction **lands in the nervous system**.  
Measured through:

- reported body sensations  
- micro-emotions  
- relational shifts  
- subjective “charge”

The Affective Resonance Test lives in `3_DATASETS/affective_resonance_test`.

---

### Field-Based Cognition

The idea that thinking is not just in the brain but **distributed across body, environment, and relational field**.  
HHI architectures treat the person as a **field node**, not an isolated mind.
