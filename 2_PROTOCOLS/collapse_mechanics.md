# Collapse Mechanics Protocol

## Purpose
Defines how systems detect, handle, and recover from collapse events.

Collapse corresponds to:
- Intensity → 0
- Semantic breakdown
- State incoherence

## Detection Criteria
A collapse event is triggered when:
- State transitions fail to preserve meaning
- Feedback loops amplify instability
- Boundary conditions are violated

## Response Sequence
1. Halt forward propagation
2. Log collapse context
3. Transition to Hollow Node
4. Await external intervention or reset

## Prohibited Actions
- Silent continuation
- Automatic semantic reconstruction
- Recursive restart without reset

Collapse is a **signal**, not an error.
