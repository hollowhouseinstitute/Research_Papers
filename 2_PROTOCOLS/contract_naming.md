# Contract Naming Protocol

## Purpose
Defines how entities, systems, and agents are named to preserve identity coherence.

Names are **contracts**, not labels.

## Naming Rules

1. Names must be stable across time
2. Renaming requires explicit declaration
3. No name reuse after collapse

## Identity Binding
A name binds:
- Historical actions
- Obligations
- Interpretive context

## Violations
Improper naming leads to:
- Identity drift
- Narrative fracture
- Accountability loss

Naming is part of system integrity.
