# Protocol Map — Overview

This directory defines the **operational protocols** derived from the canonical theory (`1_THEORY/theory.md`).

Protocols translate theory into:
- Executable constraints
- Naming conventions
- Structural rules
- Failure handling procedures

They are **not theoretical extensions**. They are implementations.

## Protocol Classes

| Protocol | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| Architect Law | Structural invariants |
| Codex Mapping | Semantic alignment |
| Collapse Mechanics | Failure handling |
| Contract Naming | Identity consistency |
| Mantra Ledger | State persistence |
| Scan Spine | System introspection |

## Governance
- Protocols may reference theory
- Protocols may not redefine theory
- Protocol conflicts defer to THEORY

Protocols are living documents but must remain internally consistent.
