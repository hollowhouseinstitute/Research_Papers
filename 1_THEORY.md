# 1_THEORY — Canonical Theory

This directory contains the **single authoritative theoretical foundation** for all Hollow House Institute research.

## Canonical Document

- `theory.md`

`theory.md` is the **only source of truth** for theoretical definitions, axioms, and results.
All applied, empirical, or speculative work must reference it explicitly.

## Scope

The theory formalizes:
- Directed, irreversible transformation (Flame Line Topologies)
- Meaning arising from absence and boundary conditions (Hollow Light)
- Reflexive epistemology (House of Mirrors Methodology)
- Linguistically maintained identity (Linguistic Self Model)
- Generalized nervous system architectures

These components are unified into a single axiomatic system.

## Governance Rules

- No parallel theory files
- No redefinition of primitives outside `theory.md`
- Amendments occur via direct edits to `theory.md`, not supplements

## Status

This directory represents a **mature theoretical core**, suitable for:
- Peer review
- Downstream application
- Formal critique and extension
