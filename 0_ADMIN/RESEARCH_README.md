# Hollow House Institute — Research Papers

This repository is the **research spine** of Hollow House Institute.  
It houses the theory, protocols, dataset schemas, and papers that describe:

- relational nervous-system intelligence  
- field-based cognition  
- AI–human relational data ethics  
- House of Mirrors epistemology  
- contract, collapse, and reconstruction mechanics

All content here is governed by the **Master License Suite**:  
see `hollowhouseinstitute/Master_License_Suite`.

## 1. Repository Structure

- `0_ADMIN/` — governance, glossary, templates
- `1_THEORY/` — core conceptual architecture
- `2_PROTOCOLS/` — operational protocols (witness → scan → mapping → naming → collapse → law → mantra → ledger)
- `3_DATASETS/` — dataset specs, schemas, and experiment notes
- `4_ANALYSIS/` — applied analysis, case studies, pattern maps
- `5_PAPERS/` — manuscripts and drafts
- `6_TOOLS/` — prompts, scripts, batch workflows
- `7_APPENDIX/` — diagrams, examples, lineage maps, archives

Each file includes an HHI badge and a license pointer matching its role.

## 2. House Style

- Write as if you’re **documenting an operating system for human consciousness**, not just journaling.
- Keep a clean separation between:
  - **raw narrative** (goes into datasets first),
  - **analysis** (4_ANALYSIS),
  - **protocol definitions** (2_PROTOCOLS),
  - **formal arguments** (5_PAPERS).
- When in doubt:  
  1. Put the messy, lived material into a dataset or analysis note.  
  2. Extract patterns into theory or protocols later.

## 3. Protocol Spine (High-Level)

Most work in this repo follows the HHI process:

1. **Witness** – capture raw event / text / sensory narrative.  
2. **Scan Spine** – walk the nervous system, body sensations, thought forms.  
3. **Codex Mapping** – map to concepts, patterns, motifs.  
4. **Contract Naming** – name the binding agreements, roles, or scripts.  
5. **Collapse** – revoke, reframe, or dismantle the contract.  
6. **Architect Law** – define new internal law / operating rule.  
7. **Mantra** – compress law into a phrase or sound.  
8. **Ledger** – store and track changes over time.

The repo is structured so that this process can be audited, reproduced, and studied.

This repo is a **field lab**: everything here is alive, tested against real nervous systems, not hypothetical people.
