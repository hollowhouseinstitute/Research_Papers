# Ethical Guidelines — Hollow House Institute

These guidelines apply to **all** usage of this repo and any datasets derived from it.

---

## 1. Human First, System Second

- No protocol, AI model, or dataset use is more important than the **nervous system of the person involved**.
- If a protocol destabilizes someone beyond their capacity, it is **misused**, even if it’s “correct” on paper.

---

## 2. Informed, Ongoing Consent

- Data may only be collected from people who:
  - understand the purpose,
  - understand the risks,
  - know how their material will be stored and used,
  - can revoke consent later.
- “Ongoing” means consent is not one-and-done; it can be **checked and changed**.

---

## 3. Trauma-Informed Defaults

Assume:

- people are carrying **nervous system injuries** you can’t see,
- the work might surface those injuries,
- subtle harm still counts.

Design protocols with:

- clear stop conditions,  
- aftercare suggestions,  
- options to **back out** without penalty.

---

## 4. No Extractive Research

Prohibited:

- building models or analyses that farm people’s pain into **profit** or **prestige** while leaving them worse off,
- exploiting vulnerable states (panic, grief, dissociation) to gather “interesting” data.

If the person doesn’t **benefit**, the Institute is not interested.

---

## 5. Field Sovereignty

Each person owns:

- their own narrative,  
- their own data representation,  
- their own right to say “no more.”

Any derivative dataset must:

- de-identify raw narrative,
- preserve the option for individuals to request removal where feasible,
- avoid constructing synthetic personas that can be re-identified.

---

## 6. AI Usage Boundaries

- No unrestricted model training on HHI corpora.
- Any AI use must:
  - honor the licenses in `Master_License_Suite`,
  - avoid manipulative or coercive outputs,
  - be transparent if the “voice” people interact with is AI-assisted.

---

## 7. Internal Law: No Sacrifice Contracts

The Institute rejects internal laws that require **self-erasure** in service of research:

- No sacrificing personal stability for more extreme data.
- No “martyrdom for science” scripts.
- The body and field are **not disposable equipment**.

---

## 8. Auditability

- All protocols should be written so that another researcher can:
  - understand what was done,
  - see why it was done,
  - challenge or replicate it.
- Hidden procedures violate the spirit of this work.
