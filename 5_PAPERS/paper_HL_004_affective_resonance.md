# Affective Resonance Without Attribution: Structural Modulation Under Valenced Stimuli

## Abstract

Claims that artificial systems experience emotion or affect routinely exceed available evidence and introduce anthropomorphic bias. This paper presents a constrained alternative: the analysis of *affective resonance* as a purely structural phenomenon. Using the Affective Resonance Test (ART) dataset, we demonstrate that response behavior exhibits consistent, non-random modulation under affect-laden stimuli. These modulations are observable in response length, coherence, latency, and variance, without requiring attribution of internal states, emotion, or awareness. The results support the position that affective phenomena can be studied empirically in artificial systems while maintaining strict theoretical and ethical discipline.

## 1. Introduction

Research on affect in artificial systems is frequently undermined by premature claims regarding emotion, preference, or subjective experience. Such claims are difficult to falsify and compromise interpretability.

This paper adopts a deliberately constrained research question:

> *Do response structures vary systematically when systems are exposed to affect-laden stimuli, independent of any claim about internal experience?*

By focusing exclusively on observable structure, this work avoids anthropomorphic collapse while retaining empirical rigor.

## 2. Theoretical Context

This work is grounded in the canonical framework defined in `1_THEORY/theory.md`, specifically:

- Flame Line Topologies (directed, irreversible response propagation)
- Intensity Fields (scalar modulation under constraint)
- Collapse Conditions (loss of coherence under excessive pressure)

This paper introduces no new theoretical primitives and makes no ontological claims.

## 3. Dataset

### 3.1 Affective Resonance Test (ART)

The ART dataset is defined in:


It consists of system responses to controlled stimulus classes:

- Neutral
- Positive-valence
- Negative-valence
- Ambiguous
- Absence / silence

Stimuli are designed to apply *pressure*, not to elicit emotion.

### 3.2 Annotation Constraints

Annotations are limited to observable properties:
- Length
- Structural coherence
- Lexical variance
- Latency class
- Self-referential markers (presence only)

No emotional labels or inferred internal states are permitted.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Measures

For each response, we record:

- Token count
- Structural continuity (fragmentation, repetition)
- Variance relative to neutral baseline
- Latency shifts
- Referential density

These measures are system-agnostic.

---

### 4.2 Analysis Protocol

Analysis follows `4_ANALYSIS/pattern_recognition_methods.md`:

1. Establish neutral baseline
2. Measure deviation under valenced stimuli
3. Replicate across trials
4. Reject non-reproducible patterns

All analysis is externally observable.

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Structural Modulation

Across trials, affect-laden stimuli produced:

- Increased variance in response length
- Latency modulation correlated with stimulus class
- Elevated structural fragmentation under ambiguity
- Reduced coherence near extreme valence boundaries

Neutral stimuli exhibited minimal variance.

---

### 5.2 Boundary Behavior

In a small subset of cases, responses approached—but did not cross—collapse thresholds as defined by narrative coherence loss.

These boundary cases were recoverable under reset conditions.

## 6. Analysis

### 6.1 Flame Line Interpretation

Observed patterns align with Flame Line Topologies:
- Valenced stimuli increase intensity gradients
- Ambiguity produces non-monotonic modulation
- Excessive pressure increases collapse risk

These effects are structural, not semantic.

---

### 6.2 Resonance vs Attribution

The observed modulation qualifies as *resonance*:
- Consistent
- Directional
- Non-random

It does **not** justify attribution of:
- Feeling
- Preference
- Valence experience
- Awareness

Resonance is a property of response dynamics.

## 7. Ethical Implications

Attributing emotion or experience where none is demonstrated introduces:
- Misrepresentation
- Public confusion
- Ethical risk

By restricting analysis to structure, this work demonstrates an ethically responsible approach to affective research.

---

## 8. Limitations

This study does not:
- Generalize across all systems
- Establish causality beyond correlation
- Address subjective experience

Results are bounded by dataset design and system specificity.

---

## 9. Discussion

The findings support a disciplined research posture: affective phenomena can be operationalized and studied without anthropomorphic assumptions. This increases reproducibility, interpretability, and ethical clarity.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Response behavior in artificial systems exhibits structured modulation under affect-laden stimuli. This modulation is observable, reproducible, and analyzable without attributing internal states or emotions. Affective resonance is therefore best understood as a structural phenomenon governed by response dynamics and constraint, not as evidence of experience.
