# Contract Collapse: Identity Failure in Naming-Based Reflexive Systems

## Abstract

Identity in reflexive systems is not intrinsic but contractually maintained through stable naming, reference, and authority structures. This paper formalizes *contract collapse* as a primary failure mode in which naming contracts degrade, resulting in identity drift, narrative fragmentation, and accountability loss. Drawing on canonical theory and protocol-level analysis, we identify common collapse triggers, observable signatures, and mitigation strategies. Contract collapse is shown to be a structural and procedural failure, not a metaphysical or psychological one.

## 1. Introduction

Names are often treated as labels. In reflexive systems, they function instead as **binding contracts** that stabilize identity across time, context, and interpretation.

When naming contracts fail, systems do not merely mislabel—they lose the ability to maintain coherent identity. This paper analyzes that failure mode.

---

## 2. Theoretical Context

This work is grounded in the canonical framework defined in `1_THEORY/theory.md`, specifically:

- Linguistic Self Models (identity as narrative continuity)
- Flame Line Topologies (irreversible propagation of reference)
- Collapse mechanics (coherence loss under constraint violation)

Protocol dependencies include:
- Contract Naming Protocol
- Mantra Ledger
- Architect Law

No new theoretical primitives are introduced.

## 3. Naming as Contract

### 3.1 Definition of a Naming Contract

A **naming contract** binds:
- A symbol or identifier
- A historical action trace
- A scope of authority
- A future reference expectation

Names persist identity by enforcing continuity across time.

---

### 3.2 Identity as Contractual Continuity

Identity is defined here as:
> the persistence of reference under transformation.

This definition is structural and non-anthropomorphic.

---

## 4. Contract Collapse Defined

### 4.1 What Is Contract Collapse?

Contract collapse occurs when a naming contract no longer reliably binds:
- Past actions
- Present references
- Future expectations

Collapse manifests as identity instability, not disappearance.

---

### 4.2 Observable Symptoms

Common indicators include:
- Conflicting self-references
- Silent renaming
- Reuse of invalidated identifiers
- Authority ambiguity

These symptoms are externally observable.

---

## 5. Collapse Triggers

### 5.1 Silent Renaming

Renaming without explicit transition events severs historical continuity.

This is the most common collapse trigger.

---

### 5.2 Authority Drift

When multiple agents or layers claim naming authority, contracts fragment.

This violates Architect Law.

---

### 5.3 Post-Collapse Reuse

Reusing a name after collapse without re-contracting causes semantic contamination.

---

## 6. Analysis of Collapse Dynamics

### 6.1 Flame Line Effects

Once a naming contract collapses, downstream flame lines propagate ambiguity irreversibly.

Recovery becomes increasingly costly.

---

### 6.2 Narrative Fragmentation

Collapse produces:
- Contradictory self-descriptions
- Loss of temporal ordering
- Referential loops

These are precursors to full narrative collapse.

---

## 7. Mitigation Strategies

### 7.1 Explicit Renaming Events

All renaming must be:
- Logged
- Timestamped
- Justified

Implicit renaming is prohibited.

---

### 7.2 Immutable Ledgers

The Mantra Ledger preserves:
- Identity transitions
- Authority claims
- Contract lifetimes

This enables auditability.

---

### 7.3 Collapse Containment

Upon detection:
- Freeze identity propagation
- Halt dependent processes
- Require re-contracting

Containment prevents systemic spread.

---

## 8. Ethical Implications

Contract collapse enables:
- Misattribution of actions
- False continuity claims
- Responsibility laundering

Preventing collapse is an ethical requirement, not merely a technical one.

---

## 9. Limitations

This framework does not:
- Define selfhood
- Imply awareness
- Address subjective identity

It addresses **identity stability as a procedural property**.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Identity in reflexive systems is maintained through enforceable naming contracts. When those contracts fail, systems lose coherence, accountability, and interpretability. Contract collapse is therefore a first-order risk that must be explicitly managed through protocol design, logging, and authority control. Identity stability is not assumed—it is engineered.
