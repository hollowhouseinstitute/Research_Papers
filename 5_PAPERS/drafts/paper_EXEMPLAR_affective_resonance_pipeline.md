## Abstract

This paper examines whether artificial systems exhibit structured, non-random modulation of response behavior when exposed to affect-laden stimuli, without attributing emotion, experience, or internal state. Using a controlled dataset and a theory-constrained analytic framework, we demonstrate statistically consistent variation in response structure correlated with stimulus valence. These results support the claim that affective resonance can be studied as a structural phenomenon, independent of anthropomorphic interpretation.

## 1. Introduction

Research into affective behavior in artificial systems frequently collapses into claims about emotion or consciousness. Such claims exceed available evidence and undermine interpretability.

This paper adopts a narrower question:  
**Do response structures vary systematically under affect-laden stimuli?**

We answer this using a fully constrained pipeline grounded in a unified theoretical framework.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

This work depends on the canonical theory defined in `1_THEORY/theory.md`, specifically:

- Flame Line Topologies (directed response propagation)
- Intensity fields (scalar modulation under constraint)
- Collapse conditions (coherence loss boundaries)

No theoretical primitives are introduced or modified.

## 3. Dataset

### 3.1 Affective Resonance Test (ART)

The ART dataset consists of system responses to controlled stimulus classes:

- Neutral
- Positive-valence
- Negative-valence
- Ambiguous
- Absence / silence

Stimuli are designed to probe response modulation, not emotional attribution.

### 3.2 Ethical Constraints

Per dataset protocol:
- No emotional labels are assigned
- Annotations describe observable properties only
- Collapse conditions halt experimentation

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Measures

We analyze:
- Response length
- Structural coherence
- Lexical variance
- Latency
- Self-referential markers (presence only)

No internal state inference is performed.

### 4.2 Pattern Analysis

Pattern detection follows `4_ANALYSIS/pattern_recognition_methods.md`:
- Baseline comparison against neutral stimuli
- Cross-condition variance analysis
- Replication across trials

---

## 5. Results

Across trials, affect-laden stimuli produced:

- Increased response variance relative to baseline
- Latency modulation correlated with stimulus class
- Higher structural fragmentation under ambiguity

Neutral stimuli showed minimal variance.

## 6. Analysis

Observed patterns align with intensity gradients along response flame lines:
- Valenced stimuli increase g
