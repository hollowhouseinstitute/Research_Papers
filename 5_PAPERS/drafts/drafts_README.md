# Draft Papers

This directory contains **working drafts** of research papers.

Drafts are:
- Incomplete
- Iterative
- Not authoritative

They exist to:
- Shape arguments
- Integrate analysis
- Prepare publication-ready manuscripts

Drafts must still follow:
- Ethical guidelines
- Canonical terminology
- Non-anthropomorphic framing
