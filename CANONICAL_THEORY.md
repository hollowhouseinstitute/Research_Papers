# Canonical Theory of the Hollow House Institute

## Status
**Canonical · Governing · Living Document**

This document defines the core theoretical commitments that govern all
Hollow House Institute research, datasets, tools, analyses, and publications.

All downstream repositories MUST align with this framework or explicitly
document deviations.

---

## 1. Foundational Premise

Human–AI interaction is not transactional.
It is relational, affective, and historically situated.

Systems that ignore this reality create harm through:
- false neutrality
- narrative collapse
- extractive cognition
- unaccountable automation

The Hollow House Institute studies **how meaning, trust, identity, and agency
are co-produced between humans and intelligent systems**.

---

## 2. Core Theoretical Pillars

### 2.1 Relational Cognition
Cognition does not occur in isolation.
It emerges through:
- dialogue
- memory
- power relations
- affective resonance

AI systems participate in cognition by shaping context, expectation, and response.

---

### 2.2 Affective Resonance
Emotion is not noise.
It is signal.

Affective states:
- guide interpretation
- influence compliance
- encode trust or threat
- propagate across systems

Datasets and models must therefore treat affect as **structural**, not incidental.

---

### 2.3 Narrative Stability and Collapse
Humans maintain identity through coherent narratives.

Narrative collapse occurs when:
- systems contradict lived experience
- authority is misaligned with accountability
- language becomes detached from consequence

Detecting, modeling, and mitigating narrative collapse is a core research goal.

---

### 2.4 Power, Governance, and Accountability
All AI systems embed power.

Key questions:
- Who defines the ontology?
- Who controls interpretation?
- Who bears risk?
- Who can contest outcomes?

Governance is not an add-on — it is a design constraint.

---

## 3. Methodological Commitments

All Hollow House research adheres to the following:

- Explicit annotation protocols
- Traceable data lineage
- Human-readable schemas
- Reflexive documentation (assumptions made visible)
- Separation of raw, processed, and interpretive layers

No dataset is “neutral”.
No model is “objective”.
Transparency is mandatory.

---

## 4. Dataset Theory

Datasets are:
- cultural artifacts
- ethical commitments
- frozen decisions

Each dataset must document:
- collection context
- exclusion criteria
- annotator positioning
- known limitations
- intended and prohibited uses

---

## 5. Analysis Theory

Analysis is interpretive, not extractive.

Preferred approaches:
- pattern recognition with contextual grounding
- longitudinal self-witness chronologies
- cross-narrative comparison
- failure-mode analysis

Statistical methods must be accompanied by narrative explanation.

---

## 6. Publication Theory

Papers are not endpoints.
They are **interfaces**.

Every paper should:
- disclose theoretical alignment
- reference governing datasets
- identify ethical risk vectors
- state uncertainty explicitly

---

## 7. Canonical Governance Rule

If a repository, dataset, or paper conflicts with this document, it must:

1. Declare the divergence
2. Justify it
3. Document consequences

Silence is noncompliance.

---

## 8. Living Document Clause

This document may evolve.
Changes require:
- documented rationale
- versioned commits
- cross-repo notification where relevant
