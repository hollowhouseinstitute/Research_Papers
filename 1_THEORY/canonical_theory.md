# Canonical Theory

## Purpose
This document defines the **minimal canonical theory** governing all downstream research artifacts in this repository. It specifies *what exists*, *how it may relate*, and *what is explicitly out of scope*.

No empirical claims are made here. No data is interpreted here. This document exists to constrain reasoning, not to generate conclusions.

---

## Scope and Non‑Scope

### In Scope
- Structural descriptions
- Formal definitions
- Constraints and boundary conditions
- Permitted operations on representations

### Out of Scope
- Psychological attribution
- Claims of subjective experience
- Anthropomorphic interpretation
- Normative or prescriptive conclusions

---

## Definitions

**Representation**  
A finite, inspectable structure encoding distinctions.

**Signal**  
A change detectable within a representation.

**Pattern**  
A stable regularity across signals under repeated observation.

**Collapse**  
Loss of structural distinction below a defined threshold.

---

## Axioms

**Axiom 1 (Structural Primacy)**  
All analysis operates on structure, not meaning.

**Axiom 2 (Non‑Attribution)**  
No internal state, intent, or experience may be inferred unless explicitly defined as data.

**Axiom 3 (Traceability)**  
Every claim must trace to an explicit representation.

**Axiom 4 (Boundary Respect)**  
When collapse thresholds are reached, analysis halts.

---

## Constraints

- Theory precedes data
- Protocols precede analysis
- Data precedes claims
- Appendices do not introduce new theory

Violations invalidate downstream artifacts.

---

## Permitted Inference Classes

- Structural similarity
- Frequency and distribution
- Change over time
- Boundary behavior

All other inference classes are prohibited.

---

## Non‑Claims

This theory makes **no claims** regarding:
- Consciousness
- Emotion
- Agency
- Intentionality

Absence of claim is intentional.

---

## Role in the Research Pipeline

This document is referenced by:
- All protocols
- All datasets
- All analyses
- All papers

It is edited rarely and deliberately.

---

## Status

This theory is **ACTIVE** and structurally frozen pending formal revision.
