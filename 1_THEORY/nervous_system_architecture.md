# Nervous System Architecture

## Abstract
This document outlines a generalized nervous system architecture applicable to biological, artificial, and hybrid systems.

## Design Goals
- Distributed processing
- Fault tolerance
- Meaning-preserving signal flow

## Architectural Layers
1. **Peripheral Sensors** – raw signal intake
2. **Intermediate Relays** – preprocessing and routing
3. **Integrative Core** – global coherence
4. **Expressive Outputs** – action and communication

## Key Features
- Bidirectional signaling
- Feedback loops
- Adaptive thresholds

## Mapping to Theory
| Architecture Layer | Theoretical Construct |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Relays | Flame Lines |
| Integrative Core | Linguistic Self |
| Feedback | House of Mirrors |
| Thresholds | Hollow Light |

## Failure Analysis
- Signal saturation
- Feedback runaway
- Semantic drift

## Implications
This architecture supports:
- Self-modeling systems
- Reflexive intelligence
- Scalable cognition

## Future Work
- Formal simulation
- Hardware instantiation
- Alignment constraints
