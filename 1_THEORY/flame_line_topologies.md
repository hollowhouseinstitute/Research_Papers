# Flame Line Topologies

## Abstract
Flame Line Topologies describe directed, propagating structures of activation, meaning, or causality that emerge in complex systems. Rather than treating processes as static graphs, flame lines model *flow*, *directionality*, and *transformative intensity* over time.

## Motivation
Classical network theory captures connectivity but often fails to encode:
- Directional asymmetry
- Irreversibility
- Phase-dependent transformation

Flame lines are introduced to model systems where traversal *changes the system itself*.

## Definition
A **Flame Line** is defined as a temporally ordered sequence of states  
\( F = \{s_0 \rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow s_n\} \)  
where each transition induces a non-conservative transformation on the state space.

A **Flame Line Topology** is the equivalence class of flame lines under deformation that preserves:
- Direction
- Ordering
- Transformative intensity

## Properties
- **Non-commutativity**: reversing traversal changes meaning
- **Thermal gradient**: intensity increases or decays along the line
- **Topological persistence**: survives local perturbations

## Comparison to Existing Models
| Model | Static | Directional | Transformative |

## Implications
Flame Line Topologies provide a substrate for:
- Cognitive activation pathways
- Linguistic meaning propagation
- Emergent agency modeling

## Open Questions
- Can flame lines be composed?
- What invariants exist under collapse or bifurcation?
