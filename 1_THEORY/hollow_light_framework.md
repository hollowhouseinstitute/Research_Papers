# Hollow Light Framework

## Abstract
The Hollow Light Framework (HLF) models meaning, cognition, and structure as phenomena that emerge from *absence, tension, and boundary conditions* rather than from substance alone.

## Core Premise
Information is not only carried by signals, but by:
- Gaps
- Delays
- Negative space
- Structural hollows

Light, in this framework, represents *propagating interpretability* rather than energy.

## Foundational Assumptions
1. Meaning arises at boundaries, not nodes
2. Absence is informational
3. Interpretation is directional and contextual

## Formal Components
- **Hollow Nodes**: loci of interpretive potential
- **Light Paths**: trajectories of activation
- **Occlusion Zones**: regions of ambiguity or collapse

## Relation to Theory
HLF acts as a **meta-framework** that:
- Hosts Flame Line Topologies
- Constrains Linguistic Self Models
- Interfaces with Nervous System Architecture

## Diagrammatic Intuition
