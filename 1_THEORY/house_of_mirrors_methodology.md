# House of Mirrors Methodology

## Abstract
The House of Mirrors Methodology (HoMM) is a recursive research approach designed to study systems that include the observer as part of the system itself.

## Problem Statement
Traditional methodologies assume:
- Observer independence
- Fixed system boundaries
- Stable semantics

These assumptions break down in:
- Cognitive science
- AI alignment
- Reflexive sociotechnical systems

## Methodological Principles
1. **Recursive Observation** – observations are themselves data
2. **Mirror Layers** – each analytic layer reflects the prior
3. **Controlled Self-Reference** – recursion without collapse

## Procedure
1. Define initial system boundary
2. Observe and model system behavior
3. Model the *modeling process*
4. Iterate with bounded depth

## Failure Modes
- Infinite regress
- Narrative overfitting
- Observer identity collapse

## Safeguards
- Depth limits
- External anchors
- Cross-observer triangulation

## Use Cases
- Theory of mind research
- AI self-modeling systems
- Epistemic risk analysis
